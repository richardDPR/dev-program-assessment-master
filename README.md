# Assessment
*This is the test assessment project for the DEV program.*

The purpouse of the pagination project is to provide functionality for data navigation.
## Project structure
### Assesment project
This library provides the next functionalities for data navigation:
 * First Page, Moves cursor to the first page 
 * Previous Page,Moves cursor to the previous page. It should return an InvalidOperationException when there is no previous page.     
 * Next Page,  Moves cursor to the next page. It should return an InvalidOperationException when there is no next page.
 * Last Page, Moves cursor to the last page
 * Go To Page, moves cursor directly to the specified page. It should return an InvalidOperationException when the page is not valid. Invalid values are: negative numbers, a value that exceeds the number of pages
 * Current Page, returns the current page
 * Pages, returns the number of pages
 * Visible items, returns the elements that are visible in the current page

You can run the unit tests with the next command:

`dotnet test .\AssessmentTest\AssessmentTest.csproj`

### Assessment console
Console program that uses the library to provide data navigation to users throught the console UI.

You can run the program with the next command:

`dotnet run -p .\AssessmentConsole\AssessmentConsole.csproj`

## Goals
You must try to accomplish as many goals as possible because this will define if you are a candidate for the next advanced levels of the program.

 1. Pagination 
    * a. Complete navigation functionalities
    * b. All pagination unit test must pass
    * c. Itendify missing scenarios to test in the Pagination code
    * d. Provide an implementation that can navigate a list of numbers
        * Implement the unit tests for GoToPage, NextPage and GetVisibleItems
    * c. Add two new functions for sorting:
      * SortAsc, sorts the data in an ascending way. The default sorting
      * SortDesc, sorts the data in a descending way 
      * Implement the unit tests
    * d. Modify the next methods to make them chainable
      * First page
      * Next page
      * Previous page
      * Last page
      * Go to page
      
      It should be possible to do the next calls:
      `pagination.GoToPage().NextPage();`
 2. Providers   
    * a. Add support to data sources that are using as separator a pipe (|)
    * b. Add support to data sources that are using as separator a white space ( )
    * c. All the provided unit tests must pass
    * d. `If you think there is a better way to define Providers, feel free to refactor the code.` 
 3. Console program
    * a. Complete all the navigation functionalities in the Console program
    * b. The console program cannot crash for invalid inputs
    * c. `Find a better way (refactor) the spaghetti code in the App.cs code, lot of if/else sentences doesn't look good.`
